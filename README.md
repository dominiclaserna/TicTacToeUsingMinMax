# TicTacToeUsingMinMax

This code implements the Min-Max algorithm that would make a smart AI agent.

Input
At the start of the program, it asks the user if it wants be X or O. X player goes first.


The output of the exercise is a Misere TicTacToe game with a SMART AI agent (using minimax algorithm and alpha beta pruning). The user should not by any means win and the best possible state only is a draw or the AI wins.
